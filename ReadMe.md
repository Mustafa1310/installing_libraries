# Installing_Libraries

#### Hey GuysðŸ‘‹
Python programmers rely heavily on libraries while programming to develop/build something new. However, one issue that is always faced by the newbie programmers is that they are sometimes unable to install different libraries required on their systems.
So here is a simple documentation that will guide the new budding developers/programmers on how to get different libraries of python on your device if you are facing an issue by taking an example of a python library <b>Pyaudio</b> 

PyAudio provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross-platform audio I/O library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms. so while installing <b>Pyaudio</b> a lot of programmers can have an encounter with this error.

This error generally occurs because there are some files missing that will help in build your library. Hence providing the build tools will be a simple soolution to solve this error.

To get all the buiding tools, go to the given link:
[Build_Tools](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)

This link contains all the modules and the build tools for almost all the libraries. To install the library click on the name of library which is in this case Pyaudio and download the file which is compatible with your version. If you use Python 3.7 then download the <b>.whl file</b> compatible with your version of python. To get the librarty working follow the given steps:
<ul>
1) Find your Python version by python --version.
  
2) Find and download the appropriate .whl file.
  
3) Go to the folder where it is downloaded

4) Install the pip file looking at the given example.
  
    `pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
`

</ul>

Hence the problem you faced while downloading the library is solved and this solution is applicable while installing almost all the python libraries.
